      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img id="profile-picture" src="_DSC4214.jpg" alt="Melissa Kjaer" />
        <p>I am a recent graduate completing my Bachelors in Business after an 18 year hiatus from school.  I made the most of the pandemic by completing 7 classes in 1.5 months cutting my graduation time by 7 months.  
This year marks my 20th anniversary with Ford Credit and I have used that time to gain experience in several different areas. 
I am currently an analyst in Written Credit disputes but have roated through Customer Serivce, Account Maintnance  Loss Prevention, Specialty Router, Bankrutpcy, Impounds,Flex Funding End of Terms and RCL Specialty.
 I am also a very happy newlywed and was married just 4 days after Covid shut down FMCC and we were sent home to work. 
        </p> 
        <p>I want to be a computer programmer because it has been a long time facination of mine.
             For Christmas 1984 I received a Commodore 64 and a subscritpin to Family Computing magazine.
              It took almost 3 days to enter the code given for the Nutcracker Suite but in the end it was magic to me to see the dancing pixels and hear the rudimenatary music that I helped to create. (Think Oregon Trail graphics set to beeping Tchikovsky). Flash forward to the days of WebTV when I would create ornate htmL emails for friends with  graphics, music and colorful backgrounds for fun. It was always facinating to me that a few keystrokes could create something that could reach people all around the world. It was alway a regret that I was talked out of computer programming and into Business Administration for my degree. With the knowledge I have obtained these last 6 weeks I plan on moving forward coding again even if it's not in the FMCC learn to code program. 
            I had forgotton how much I loved it.  </p>
