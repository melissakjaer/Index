      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img id="profile-picture" src="_DSC4214.jpg" alt="Melissa Kjaer" />
        <p>I am a recent graduate completing my bachelorâ€™s degree in Business Administration after an 18-year hiatus from school. 
          I made the most of the pandemic by completing 7 classes in one and a half months which shortened my time to graduation by 7 months. 
          This year marks my 20th anniversary with Ford Credit, and I have used that time to gain experience in several different areas. 
          I am currently an analyst in the  Written Credit Dispute Department but have rotated through Customer Service, Account Maintenance Loss Prevention, Specialty Router, Bankruptcy, Impounds, Flex Funding, Lease End of Terms and RCL Specialty. 
          I am also a very happy newlywed and was married just 4 days after Covid shut down FMCC we started working from home. 
        </p> 
        <p>I want to be a computer programmer because it has been a long-time fascination of mine. 
          For Christmas 1984 I received a Commodore 64 and a subscription to Family Computing magazine. 
          It took almost 3 days to enter the code given for the Nutcracker Suite but in the end, it was magic for me to see the dancing pixels and hear the rudimentary music that I helped to create. (Think Oregon Trail graphics set to beeping Tchaikovsky). 
          Flash forward to the days of WebTV when I would create ornate HTML emails for friends with graphics, music and colorful backgrounds for fun. It was always fascinating to me that a few keystrokes could create something that could reach people all around the world. 
          It was always a regret that I was talked out of computer programming and into Business Administration for my degree. 
          With the knowledge I have obtained these last 6 weeks I plan on moving forward coding again even if it's not in the FMCC learn to code program. 
          I had forgotten how much I loved creating in HTML.  </p>
